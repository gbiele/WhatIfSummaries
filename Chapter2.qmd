## Randomization

- When subjects are assigned to one of several groups with help of a random device we call this random allocation.
- This is useful not because this "balances" the group with respect to known covariates
- Instead, it insures that the expected outcome of the two groups would be the same, if they were to receive the same treatment
  - If this is the case, we call the groups exchangeable
  
The fundament of causal inference rests is not balance, but exchangeability of the treatment groups

## Notation

- $\small Y^a$: The *potential outcome* $\small Y$ (not observed) under treatment $\small a$
- $\small Pr[Y = 1| A = 1]$: The proportion of cases with the *observed outcome* $\small Y=1$, among those with the *observed treatment* $\small A=1$.
- $\small Pr[Y^a = 1| A = 0]$: The proportion with the *potential outcome for treatment* $\small Y^a$ being $\small 1$ , among those with the *observed treatment* $\small A = 0$.

## Exchangebility

If we want to estimate the effect $\small A \rightarrow Y$ as

$$\small \textrm{Effect} = Pr[Y = 1| A = 1] - Pr[Y = 1| A = 0]$$ 

This requires that the *potential outcome* of treatment $\small a$, $Y^a$, is equal for those *observed* with ($\small A=1$) and without ($\small A=0$) treatment.

$$\small Pr[Y^a=1|A=1] = Pr[Y^a=1|A=0]$$


## Exchangebility

If the potential outcomes are the same irrespective of the observed treatment ($\small Pr[Y^a=1|A=1] = Pr[Y^a=1|A=0]$), they are independent

$$Y^a \perp A$$

If the potential outcomes are independent of the treatment, we say the the treatment and the control group are *exchangeable* (wrt. to the potential outcomes) or that the treatment is *exogenous*.

## Exchangebility

- is an assumption that we need to calculate treatment as $ATE$s
- if we can justify this assumption, we can calculate treatment effects as the difference in the average outcome of the treated and the untreated.
- the assumption cannot be verified, but randomization produces exchangeability

## Randomization in action

Experiment with $\small Pr[Y^0, A=1] = 0.5, Pr[Y^1, A=1] = 0.8$

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=2}
par(mfrow = c(1,4), mar=c(3,3,2,1), mgp=c(2,.5,0), tck=-.015)
for (N in c(50, 100, 500, 1000)) {
  effect = c()
  for (k in 1:5000) {
    PO_Ya0 = sample(c(0,1), N, prob = c(0.5, 0.5), replace = TRUE)
    PO_Ya1 = sample(c(0,1), N, prob = c(0.2, 0.8), replace = TRUE)
    
    idx_A1 = sample(c(TRUE,FALSE),N, replace = TRUE)
    effect = c(effect,mean(PO_Ya1[idx_A1]) - mean(PO_Ya0[!idx_A1]))
  }
  hist(effect, main = paste0("N=",N), breaks = seq(-.3,.8, by = .02),
       xlim = c(-.1,.7), xlab = "estimated effect", border = "NA")
  abline(v = 0.3, col = "red", lwd = 1)
  abline(v = 0, lty = 3)
}
```

Randomization insures exchangeability for large N, or on average for many experiments.
For small N experiments exchangeability is only an unverifiable assumptions!


## Conditional randomization

- without any qualifier, randomization is assumed to mean *marginal randomization*: All units are randomized equally 
<br> ($\small Pr[A=1|L=0] = Pr[A=1|L=1]$)
- in *conditional randomization* different strata $\small L$ are randomized according to different randomization schemes 
<br> ($\small Pr[A=1|L=0] \neq Pr[A=1|L=1]$)
- when strata $L$ are have different potential outcomes, $\small Pr[Y^{a=0}=1 | L=0] \neq Pr[Y^{a=0}=1 | L=1]$, potential outcomes of the treated and untreated will not be equal under *conditional randomization*: $Y^a \not\perp A$
  

## Conditional exchangeability

In conditional randomization, exchangeability is holds within $\small L$

$$\small Pr[Y^a=1|A=1,L=1] = Pr[Y^a=1|A=0,L=1]$$

conditional randomization induces independence of potential outcomes and treatment in the strata:

$$Y^a \perp A | L = 1 \textrm{ and } Y^a \perp A | L = 0$$

or short

$$Y^a \perp A | L$$ 

## Standardization

Calculate average risk in treatments, then effects

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
|      | $L=0$ | $L=1$ |
|------|------|------|
| $A=0$  |$\small 1/4$ | $\small 4/6$|
| $A=1$  |$\small 2/4$ | $\small 4/6$|
|      |$\tiny n=8$| $\tiny n=12$    |

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
$$
\small RISK_{A=\color{Red}{1}} = 0.4\frac{2}{4}+0.6\frac{4}{6}=0.6 \\
\small RISK_{A=\color{Red}{0}} = 0.4\frac{1}{4}+0.6\frac{4}{6}=0.5 \\
\small ATE = 0.6/0.5 = 1.2
$$

Generally:
$$
\frac
{\sum_l Pr[Y=1|L=l,A=\color{Red}{1}]Pr[L=l]}
{\sum_l Pr[Y=1|L=l,A=\color{Red}{0}]Pr[L=l]}
$$


## Standardization?

Calculate effects first in strata, then average effects

|      | $L=0$ | $L=1$ |
|------|------|------|
| $A=0$  |$\small 1/4$ | $\small 4/6$|
| $A=1$  |$\small 2/4$ | $\small 4/6$|
|      |$\tiny n=8$| $\tiny n=12$    |

$$
\small ATE_{L=0} = \frac{2}{4}/\frac{1}{4}=2 \textrm{, }
ATE_{L=1} = \frac{4}{6}/\frac{4}{6}=1 \\
\small ATE = 0.4\cdot 2 + 0.6\cdot 1 = 1.4
$$


## Inverse probability weighting

|      | $L=0$ | $L=1$ |
|------|------|------|
| $A=0$  |$\small 1/4$ | $\small 4/6$|
| $A=1$  |$\small 2/4$ | $\small 4/6$|
|      |$\tiny n=8$| $\tiny n=12$    |

$$
\small Pr[Y^{a=0} = 1] = 2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 4 = 10 \\
\small Pr[Y^{a=1} = 1] = 2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 4 = 12 \\
\small ATE = 12 / 10 = 1.2
$$
